# TIC-TAC-TOE
Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player strategy game played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns placing their symbols (X or O) in empty squares, aiming to form a line of three of their symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The first to achieve this wins, while blocking the opponent is crucial to prevent their victory.
